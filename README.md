# horiseon-website

## Deployed Application: 

## Description: 
In this task,  I was responsible of refactoring the code without changing the functionality of the Horiseon Social Solutions Website.

First of all I was focused on accesibility of the HTML code. I have noticed some  issues in the HTML code and replaced some non-semantic tags with semantic tags which will improve the accesibility features so i made sure site is optimized for search engines. Also for the same reason I added a title for the page and "alt" attributes to <img> tags.

On the other hand,  I simplified the CSS  code by grouping classes  without changing the functionality of the  site. 

Also, I worked on blank lines and spaces between tags, properties and values to enhance the structure of the code.

Finally, I created HTML and CSS comments, especially about the changes I made, to make the code  understandable during the development process for my co-workers.

I noticed that, more improvement (especially functionality) can be applied to this project  and I am sure my co-workers will be working on other issues soon. My aim was creating a cleaner code for them for an easy start.
